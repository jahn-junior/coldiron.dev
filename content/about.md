# JJ Coldiron

Technical author @ [Canonical](https://canonical.com). Based out of Puyallup,
Washington, US.

After graduating from the University of Washington, I managed to parlay my love of open
source into a career. These days, I maintain Canonical's documentation tooling and write
the documentation for the craft apps.

I love thoughtful tools and text. In my free time, I'm often found reading a good book
or tinkering with new software and gadgets.
