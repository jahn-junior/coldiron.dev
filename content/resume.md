## Overview

Experienced technical writer and software engineer.

I have spent the last year of my career writing open source documentation for users and
developers. My professional experience is with Sphinx documentation, but I've also
worked with Hugo and Docusaurus.

I have one year of experience writing production Python code and am comfortable with
Java and C#. As a result of my work with static site generators, I also have basic
proficiency with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In university, my studies were focused on cryptography and neuroevolutionary algorithms.
