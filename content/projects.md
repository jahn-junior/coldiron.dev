If you'd like to see what I'm working on each day, check out my
[GitHub](https://github.com/jahn-junior).

If not, here are some of the highlights:

## [reLabel](https://github.com/jahn-junior/sphinx-relabel)

reLabel is a tool for redirecting labels in Sphinx documentation.

Technical writers go to great lengths to redirect pages and keep links healthy, but we
rarely show the same care with Sphinx labels and references. reLabel was my answer to
that problem.

## [Kitbash](https://github.com/canonical/pydantic-kitbash)

Kitbash is a tool that generates Sphinx documentation for Pydantic models.

I wrote Kitbash in early 2025 to generate the YAML references for Canonical's craft
tools. To see this in action, check out the [snapcraft.yaml
reference](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/latest/reference/project-file/snapcraft-yaml/#reference-snapcraft-yaml)
and its [reST
source](https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft/blob/main/docs/reference/project-file/snapcraft-yaml.rst?plain=1).
